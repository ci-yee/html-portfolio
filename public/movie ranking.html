<h1>My Top Three Movies</h1>

<h2>I think...</h2>

<hr />

<h3>Come On, Come On</h3>
<p>Watched it winter 2021, on a solo movie date at
 Tivoli just before Christmas holiday. <br />
I remember crying a lot by  myself sitting at the 
back row of the cinema every 20 minutes of the film.
It was a simple, heart-warming film shot in black and 
white. By far one of the best films I've watched.
No fancy sfx or massive budgets, just a humble film 
that touches your heart through story-telling.</p>

<h3>Everything, everywhere, all at once</h3>
<p>Not much to say about this film other than just 
pure chaotic energy. At multiple points of the film
I thought this could easily be such a trash film but 
they've somehow made it so so good, it was simply
iconic.</p>

<h3>Your Name</h3>
<p>Was my favourite film for a long time until the whole 
time-travelling loop hole started bothering me.
Nonetheless, it was a film that made me extremely delulu 
and I still beleive in parallel multiverse and 
all that jazz.</p>
